#### Searching by item name
Press **t** to open Github's file finder and type the name of the item your are looking for.
You will see a list of NPCs buying that item together with its price and the NPC's location.

#### Searching by NPC name
You can also search for a NPC name and get a list of all items sold by that NPC.
In case more entries than just the NPC's offers show up just type some more letters of the path e.g.:
* **Baxter (Tha** or **Baxter Thais** instead of **Baxter** 
* **Rashid/** instead of just **Rashid**
